> "I signed up for Improv 101 because it intimidated me, but Daniel has an incredible way of making everyone feel at ease. Though I was nervous at first, each session and every scene helped me relax and grow more comfortable. By the end, I didn't just gain confidence and quick thinking skills, I also met some truly kind, amazing people and made friendships that I hope will last a lifetime."
